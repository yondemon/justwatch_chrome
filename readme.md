## Questions ##
### Developers: How to add another web page to be parsed ###
I am open to new additions via pull request. ;)

Search is based on 3 params: Title, Type (Movie o Show) and Release Year.

1. Create a new entry on supportedWeb array on main.js with this index:
 - **'block'**: function with selector where to append the information block
 - **'title'**: function with selector where to get the title
 - **'year'**: function with selector on where to get the year
 - **'type'**: (optional) string "show", "movie"
 
   ***Note:*** Some web pages have ld-json information, so we can get title and year directly. In those cases add an empty function for title and year. Block in mandatory in any case.

2. Add the URL to activate to the manifest.json, on matches.

Reload the extension and navigate to the page... and JustWatch!
